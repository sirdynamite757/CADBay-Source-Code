Any repositories under this license exist for the express purpose of following the rule, "if you can't read the source code don't trust it".
This license does not allow any reproduction, reuse, or "forks" outside of the entity that creates the repo.
If our legal team is notified of any breach of this license, legal action can be expected in short order.
At CADBay we find that "legaleese" is anoying and prefer considerably blunt langauge. If this approach offends you do not contact us about it as they will put our founder on the phone and he will laugh very hard.
If you have any sugestions for fixes or improvements please submit the corresponding issue report. Who knows you might get a job offer.
If our Software Engineering team sees a new fork our Legal Team will be notified.
Do not download this repo for public, private, or corporate use.
We will know if this repo is used as the base of another WebPage, do not think you can hide it. Our Sofrtware Engineering Team is very bad at their job.
